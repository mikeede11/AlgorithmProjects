grade: 8/10.

nice work, but: submitted late.  Instead of automatic 0 (by the
explicit rules), only deducting 2 points because first time this
semester.  In the future, if you want to use a late pass, go ahead and
tell me up-front: otherwise, it gives the impression that you're
trying to "slip something through".
